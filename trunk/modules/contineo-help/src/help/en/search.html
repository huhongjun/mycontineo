          <p>Two various modalities of search are possible to carry out searches between documents archiviati in the system being used: Simple search and <a href="#advanced">Advanced Search</a>.</p> <h3>Simple search  </h3> 
          <br>
          The mask of simple search is always present and accessible anytime in the advanced part of the window.<br> It is important to specify the language in which the search is wanted to be executed. Of base the system proposes the Document language default of the customer (in Italian).  <br> Starting the simple search it will come only inside searched of the archive in the base language (and not on documents in other languages).<br> If instead we will want to search on documents written in any language it is necessary to select the option â€œAll the documentsâ€?.<br>

          <div align="center">
            <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
              <tbody><tr>
                <td class="noteHeader" height="25" width="180"><img src="images/note_ico.gif" height="10" hspace="4" width="10">Famous:</td>

              <tr>
                <td colspan="2" class="noteBody">The search on documents in an only language is of norm the much fastest one that a search carried out on All documents.</td>

            </tbody></table>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          Of every found element they come shown the title it, an extract of the containing text the tried words, the dimension in KBytes, a score of score and the link for: 
          
          <ul> 
            <li>To unload the document (title it of the document)  <br> 
            </li>
            <li>To approach the folder father (You open in the folder)  </li> 
            <li>To visualize similar documents (similar Documents)  </li> 
          </ul>
          <br>
          The presentation of the result happens in form of a list ordered on the base of the score score.<br> The score score comes inside calculated on the frequency of the tried terms (or words with common root) of the text of the files.  <br> 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div>
            <div align="center"><img src="images/searchresults.gif" height="494" width="766"></div>
          </div>
          <p>In case of multiple result the system will produce more pages than turned out that they could be consulted pressing the keys cursor low to right of the page of the result.  <br> 
            <br>
            <strong>To search on more words.</strong><br> It is possible to search at the same time on more terms, specifying as an example â€œfuture remote controlâ€? in the search field they will come found all documents that they have the words indicated in the text, not only, will come shown also the documents that contain 2 of the 3 words or 1 single one of the 3 words.<br> Verrano moreover shown the documents that contain the words derived from control es: to control, controlled, controller, those derived from remote: , remotissimmo and those which they have like that is future root futur, remotely future.  <br> 
            <br>
            <strong>To use operating the logical ones</strong> <br> In the form of simple search it is already possible to use for research purposes operating.<br> Using characters â€œ<strong>+</strong>â€? andâ€? <strong>-</strong> â€œit is possible to execute searches on obliged terms and in exclusion. As an example composing the phrase â€œcontracted +futura - planâ€? the system will search all the documents that have â€œthe futureâ€? word compulsorily and that compulsorily they do not contain the word â€œplanâ€?, while â€œthe contractedâ€? term comes inserted like optional.<br> Future a simple search â€œrapportiniâ€? instead will find all the documents in which one of the 2 terms appears at least.<br> A search of the type â€œactivity - contractedâ€? it will produce all the documents that contain the word â€œactivityâ€? and that at the same time they do not contain â€œthe contractedâ€? word.  <br> To search <strong>â€œ+rossi +marioâ€?</strong> is equivalent toâ€? <strong>red AND mario "</strong> that is means that we will try all the documents in which the words appear both red and mario.<br> It is also possible to esplicitare these searches as an example â€œfuture AND directly plan NOT developmentâ€? is equivalent to â€œ+futura +progetto - developmentâ€?.<br> When they are used operating logical like AND, OR, NOT is necessary to keep in mind that they must be written compulsorily in capital.  </p> <h3><a name="advanced" />Advanced search</h3> 
          <br>
          The mask of advanced search is accessible pressing link â€œthe advanced Searchâ€? present to flank of the form of simple search in the advanced part of the window.<br> 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div>
            <div align="center"><img src="images/searchadvanced00.gif" height="62" width="398"></div>
          </div>
          <br>
          The difference regarding the simple search is that such mask concurs contemporanemente to specify in simple way complex and active criteria of search.  <br> Using the extensive search it is possible to try simple words or phrases. Some words can moreover be excluded the search or to activate an approximate search.<br> The result can be narrow based on the dimension, to the date and the format of documents.<br> 
          <br>
          Between the important aspects of such search:<br> 
          <ul>
            <li>the advance possibility of search for terms that concur to express complex filters<br> 
            </li>
            <li>searching for dimension of documents</li> 
            <li>the search for date of the document (gestibile in the insertion mask/modification document)</li> 
            <li>the search for publication date (last modification to the document)</li> 
          </ul>
          <br>
          The product of the procedure of advanced search comes introduced in the same form of that one of the simple search and the documents are accessible with the same modalities.
